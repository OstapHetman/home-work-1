                    <strong>New patrol police to get on beat in Lviv</strong>
                <br>
                        <i>The highly-paid newly formed police will start patrolling Lviv streets one week earlier than planned, says head of the public consultative council at the city police department Rustam Kurbanor</i>
                <br>
                            <small>The new patrolmen, many of them women, were trained by US instructors and will wear the uniforms styled as the ones worn by American cops.
To unveil the new police, Deputy Interior Minister Eka Zguladze, the mother of police reforms in Ukraine and Georgiaâ€™s interior minister in the Saakashvili cabinet, is coming to Lviv Aug. 17.</small>
